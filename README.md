Simple MVC in Php


Introduction to MVC

The Model-View-Control (MVC) pattern, originally formulated in the late 1970s, is a software architecture pattern built on the basis of keeping the presentation of data separate from the methods that interact with the data. In theory, a well-developed MVC system should allow a front-end developer and a back-end developer to work on the same system without interfering, sharing, or editing files either party is working on.

<b>Controller</b>

he final component of the triad is the Controller. Its job is to handle data that the user inputs or submits, and update the Model accordingly. The Controllerâ€™s life blood is the user; without user interactions, the Controller has no purpose. It is the only part of the pattern the user should be interacting with.
